transactional-update NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

Copyright (C) 2016, 2017, 2018 Thorsten Kukuk

Version 2.10
* Introduce /etc overlays
  * Each root file system snapshot now has a dedicated /etc overlay in
    /var/lib/snapshots/<snapshot number>/etc
  * Changes in older snapshots will be visible in newer snapshots (if
    the file hasn't been changed in both snapshots), but not the other
    way around; this makes it possible to roll back to a previous
    snapshot even if the configuration is broken
  * The /etc state of the oldest active snapshot will be synchronized
    into the new snapshot to prevent ever growing overlays
  * Removed creation of /etc backup snapshots
  * Removed complex overlayfs cleanup handling during dracut early boot;
    only thing left is to output a warning if files have been changed
    in old and new overlay after snapshot creation
  * Unused overlays will be removed during "cleanup" operation
* Add compatibility with snapper >= 0.7.0
* Correctly detect BTRFS ID when using multiple snapper configurations
* Fix disappearing prompt in "shell" command when application was updated
* Prevent accidental rollback on fast reboots (boo#1111786)
* Use zypper attribute packages-to-change if available (boo#1105992 &
  boo#1097619)
* Add kexec as reboot alternative
* Added explicit --with-doc / --without-doc build configure opttions for
  enforcing or excluding documentation build
* Removed precompiled documentation (boo#1088676)
* Added more dependency checks to configure script
* Small improvements to documentation
* Restored compatibility with older rsync versions not supporting the -x
  filter
* Small bugfixes for cleanup in error situations
* Fix possible incorrect detection of snapshots numbers during cleanup
* Mention parent in snapshot description

Version 2.6
* Add --interactive and --non-interactive options to change the default
  interactivity for zypper calls. For previously non-interactive calls (e.g.
  dup) these options makes it possible to pick the correct solution in case
  of conflicts or make sure that a script will never be stuck at an input
  prompt.
* Add kured reboot support
* Tries to clean up temporary files and mount points if transactional-update
  quits unexpectedly
* Remove trancactional-update-helper (replaced by zypper options)
* Create /var/lib/zypp if not available (boo#1104452)
* Add compatibility with new zypper versions (boo#1105992)
* Various small fixes

Version 2.5
* Support for overlayfs attributes like trusted.overlay.opaque - this will
  avoid disappearing configuration files on system updates
* Documentation update
* Only sync /etc if it's on an overlayfs mount
* Use correct locale for zypper - thus updating locale specific packages and
  avoiding "empty" updates where transactional-update didn't see the change
