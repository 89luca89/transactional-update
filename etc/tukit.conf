# Bind mount additional directories into the update environment; to add
# multiple directories add a separate entry with a different id between the
# brackets for each.
# Be aware that transactions are only done the root file system itself, i.e.
# any additional mounts added here will *not* get a seperate snapshot (so
# their contents cannot be rolled back) and the changes will be visible to
# the running system immediately (breaking the transactional concept and
# possibly resulting in a mix between old and new files if there are also
# changes to the root file system until the next reboot).
# By default only /opt will be bind-mounted, as this directory is often
# used by third-party packages, but the applications in there are usually
# self-contained.
