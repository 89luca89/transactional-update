Copying
=======
transactional-update is covered under two separate licenses: GPLv2+ and
LGPLv2.1+.


GPLv2+
------
The entire code base may be distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public License version 2 and any later version (GPLv2+).
The complete text of the license is available in the gpl-2.0.txt file.


LGPLv2.1+
---------
Alternatively, all of the source code in 'lib' and 'include' subdirectories of
the transactional-update source code distribution as well as any code derived
from that code may instead be distributed under the
GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1 and any later version (LGPLv2.1+),
at the choice of the distributor.
The complete text of the license is available in the lgpl-2.1.txt file.

This alternative is provided to enable applications to be linked against
the tukit library without forcing such applications to be distributed under
the GPL.
